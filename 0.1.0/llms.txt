# Hypabase

> A Python library for storing and querying n-ary relationships with provenance tracking. SQLite-backed, zero configuration.

Hypabase is a Python library for storing and querying relationships between entities. A single edge connects two or more nodes, every edge tracks where it came from (source and confidence), and the whole graph lives in a local SQLite file with no server or configuration. Use it to build knowledge graphs, RAG pipelines, and structured agent memory. Python 3.10+. uv add hypabase.
