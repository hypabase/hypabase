# Hypabase

> A Python hypergraph library with provenance and SQLite persistence.

Hypabase is a Python hypergraph library with provenance and SQLite persistence. A single edge connects two or more nodes. Every edge tracks where it came from (source and confidence). Data persists to a local SQLite file automatically. Python 3.10+. uv add hypabase.


## Getting Started

- [Home](https://docs.hypabase.app/latest/index.md): Quick install and first hypergraph — go from zero to a working knowledge graph
- [Getting Started](https://docs.hypabase.app/latest/getting-started/index.md): Step-by-step setup with SQLite persistence, namespace isolation, and provenance
- [Concepts](https://docs.hypabase.app/latest/concepts/index.md): Core mental model — hyperedges, provenance, vertex-set index

## Guides

- [Provenance](https://docs.hypabase.app/latest/guides/provenance/index.md): Track where every relationship came from and how confident you are in it
- [Batch Operations](https://docs.hypabase.app/latest/guides/batch-operations/index.md): Ingest thousands of nodes and edges efficiently with batch, upsert, and cascade delete
- [Knowledge Graphs](https://docs.hypabase.app/latest/guides/knowledge-graphs/index.md): Build knowledge graphs with hyperedges and provenance tracking
- [Hybrid Vector Search](https://docs.hypabase.app/latest/guides/hybrid-vector-search/index.md): Combine hypergraph queries with vector similarity search
- [CLI Quickstart](https://docs.hypabase.app/latest/guides/cli/index.md): Create nodes, edges, and run queries from the terminal without writing Python
- [HIF Import/Export](https://docs.hypabase.app/latest/guides/hif/index.md): Import and export hypergraphs using the HIF interchange format
- [MCP Server](https://docs.hypabase.app/latest/guides/mcp/index.md): Set up the MCP server so AI agents in Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf can use Hypabase as structured memory
