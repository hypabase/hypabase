        Hypabase is a Python hypergraph library with provenance and SQLite
        persistence. A single edge connects two or more nodes. Every edge
        tracks where it came from (source and confidence). Data persists to a
        local SQLite file automatically. Python 3.10+. uv add hypabase.

          - comparisons/vs-hypernetx.md: "Hypabase vs HyperNetX — storage and provenance vs analysis and visualization"
          - comparisons/vs-neo4j.md: "Hypabase vs Neo4j — native hyperedges vs property graph with reification"
