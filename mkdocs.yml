      markdown_description: >
        Hypabase is a Python library for storing and querying relationships
        between entities. A single edge connects two or more nodes, every edge
        tracks where it came from (source and confidence), and the whole graph
        lives in a local SQLite file with no server or configuration. Use it to
        build knowledge graphs, RAG pipelines, and structured agent memory.
        Python 3.10+. uv add hypabase.
